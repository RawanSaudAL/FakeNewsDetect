Project Overview
With the increase in misinformation, it’s essential to have tools that help distinguish genuine news from fake. This project builds a classifier to detect fake news using text data and NLP. The approach combines multiple machine learning techniques, including preprocessing of text, feature extraction, and model training to ensure accurate classification.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, containing a large number of news articles labeled as either real or fake. This labeled dataset is crucial for training the machine learning model effectively.

Key Features of the Dataset:
Title: The headline or title of the news article.
Text: The main content or body of the news article.
Label: Classification label (real or fake).
